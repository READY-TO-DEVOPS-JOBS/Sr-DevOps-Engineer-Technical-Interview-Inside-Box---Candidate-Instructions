# Use the official NGINX image as a base
FROM nginx:latest

# Copy custom index.html file to NGINX html directory
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80


Explanation:
FROM nginx
:

This line specifies that we're basing our image on the latest NGINX image available on Docker Hub.
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html:

Copies the index.html file from your local directory into the NGINX default HTML directory (/usr/share/nginx/html/).
EXPOSE 80:

Opens port 80, which is the default port for HTTP traffic in NGINX.
Steps to Use:
Create index.html:

Create an index.html file in the same directory as your Dockerfile. You can put any HTML content you want in this file.
Example index.html:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hello Docker NGINX</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello from Docker NGINX!</h1>
    <p>This NGINX container has been customized.</p>
</body>
</html>
